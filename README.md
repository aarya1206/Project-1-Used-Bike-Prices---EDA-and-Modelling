# Bike Prices: Feature Engineering and EDA

## Overview
This project aims to predict used bike prices through comprehensive data analysis and machine learning. The dataset includes features like model year, kilometers driven, owner details, and bike power, which are used to train a linear regression model to forecast bike prices.

## Data Source
Data is compiled from used bike sales records detailing model characteristics, ownership history, and transaction prices.

## Installation
To set up the project environment:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
python bike_prices_prediction.py
# or
jupyter notebook bike_prices_prediction.ipynb
